# LinCQA

The repository is created for the purpose of storing the full paper of **Faster Rewritings for Consistent Query Answering** and the artifact to reproduce the results in the paper.

### Systems

* **CAvSAT**:
The jar file of *[CAvSAT](https://github.com/uccross/cavsat)* *cavsat.jar* is acquired from the author of *[A SAT-based System for Consistent Query Answering] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02828)*
